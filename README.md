# p1-bargain
This is a description of our P1 project.

## Git
This repository is set up such that no one but the owner has permissions to push directly to the main branch. Instead, everyone must push their changes to seperate branches, and then create a pull request for someone else to sign off on.

## Setup
This project comes with setup for cmake, but does **NOT** include any build tools.
